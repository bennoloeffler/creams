# CREAMS
CREAMS is a very easy to use CRM for small teams.  
**CRM** as **E**vernote **A**pplication as a **S**ervice  
**C**RM for T**EAMS**

## concept
1. Your CRM is basically ONE Notebook with many leads, one note for each lead.
2. this notebook is called CREAMS_LEADS
3. Every lead can have some attachmends (links to other notes - emails, pdfs, ...).
4. the attachmends are stored in a notebook called CREAMS_ATTACHMENTS
5. finally, you may run many operations by email - just rembembering few commands.
6. There are no forms - it's just text
7. CREAM extracts from this text and produces TODO-Lists and sends you E-Mails to remember you to important planned contact points.

## what you need
1. an evernote account 
(free, premium, business)   
2. 5 minutes to configure CREAMS
